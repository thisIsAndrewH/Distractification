# Slack Message Counter #
**Goal:** To gain a better understanding of how often messages are sent in a given day or week.
## How To
To run this app, you must create a test API token from the Slack development page. [https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-test-tokens](https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-test-tokens) (Future OAuth TBD.)

Add your token to the Config.swift file before running.

## TODO
* Add schedule to run automatically
* Define thresholds for alerts
* Implement notifications
* Add user authentication
* Review/adjust to Slack guidlines and submit app for review
